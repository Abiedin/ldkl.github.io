			<p>Privacy Policy</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text_pol_kon">
			<p class="p_stom_u">StomatUA</p>
			<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT CAREFULLY.</p>
			<p>It explains how the Stomatua and/or its subsidiary and affiliated entities (collectively,” “we,” “us” or “our”) collects information about you (whether you’re a parent or a child) through our website and how this information is then used or disclosed. This Privacy Policy statement does not apply to those of our websites that do not display or link to this statement or that have their privacy policy statements or to information we may collect from you or about you in other ways, including through emails you may send to us. We may update this statement from time to time by posting updated terms. You are responsible for periodically reading this statement. If you use the Stomatua™ website after we have updated this statement, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices.</p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy statement describes our privacy practices, including what information we collect from you through this website, and what we then do with this information. If you are a minor, please be sure to get your parents to review and discuss this privacy policy statement with you, and get their permission, before using the Stomatua site.</p>
			<p>We encourage parents to talk about what information their children should and shouldn’t share online, and other restrictions on the online release of personal information to anyone they don’t know. We hope that our privacy practices as described in this statement will remove any concerns that parents may have about their children visiting the Stomatua site. We do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 18.</p>
			<p>By using the Stomatua website, you acknowledge that you have read this privacy policy statement and consent to our privacy practices as described in this statement, including our use and disclosure of personal information for the purposes described below. This statement is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any person.</p>
			<p>IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE Stomatua WEBSITE.</p>
			<p>Information we Collect Through the Stomatua Website</p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy statement only applies to information that we collect through the Stomatua website and does not apply to any information we collect through any other means. We collect two types of information from you and other visitors: (1) “personally identifiable information” (as described below) and (2) non-personally identifiable information (as described below).</p>
			<p>“Personally identifiable information” is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. Here are some examples of how we may collect and store your personally identifiable information through our websites:</p>
			<p> -  We may collect your email address, first and last name, and zip code, if you sign up for an online newsletter.</p>
			<p> -  We may collect your email address if you contact us with a question.</p>
			<p> -  We may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes.</p>
			<p> -  we may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information to enable you to make a purchase.</p>
			<p>“Non-personally identifiable information” can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does not identify you personally. If you do provide us with non-personally identifiable information, we may use it for the purposes described in this statement or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose. Here are some examples of how we may collect and store your non-personally identifiable information through our websites, and how we use such information:</p>
			<p> -  Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your “IP address” is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the screens and pages of the Stomatua website that you view. We use this information to deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our websites to the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and within our websites.</p>
			<p> -  Cookie. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Stomatua website. For example, when you visit a screen or page a cookie is placed on your computer (if you or your browser accepts the cookie). This cookie may then be read by screen or pages on our website. You may configure your browser to notify you or to reject and block cookies, but if you do, you may not have access to some areas of the Stomatua website, or to the personalized features of our websites.</p>
			<p> -  Web Beacon. A “web beacon,” “clear gif,” “web bug,” or “pixel tag” is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier that is similar in function to a cookie, but allows us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of the Stomatua website, and help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens.</p>
			<p> -  Demographic Information. “Demographic information” may be your gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about you through the Stomatua website and use it to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure that our site and services and the information on them is targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.</p>

			<p> -  To offer you products from our affiliates, strategic partners, agents, or from third-party marketers and other unaffiliated parties that we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist such parties for research, administrative, and/or business purposes.

			<p> -  To track and analyze non-identifying, aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</p>
			<p> - To protect against fraud and potential fraud. Through third party services, we may verify the information obtained from the Stomatua website. In the course of such verification, we may receive additional personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address match the information you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. </p>
			<p></p>
